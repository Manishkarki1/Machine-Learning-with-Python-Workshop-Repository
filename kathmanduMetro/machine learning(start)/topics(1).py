=>types of ML
1.supervise= level data
    i)regression: there is dependent and independent variable. 
      if there is more variable then there will be more accurancy
      it is used to predict continous value.for eg: stock market, salary etc
      a) linear regression
      b) multiple regression
      c) support vector machine
      d) decision tree regression
      e) random forest regression

    ii)classification: it is all about true and false. ki ta yo ki ta yo
       used for categorical data. To classified data
       types of 
       a) logistics
       b) knn 
       c) support vector machine
       d) decision tree classification
       e) random forest classification
       f) naive bayes
       
       
2. unsupervise = unlevel data
     here we predict by seeing color, size and shape
     a) clustoring : it form a group. mainly used k mean algorithm
     b) Association
3. reinformance
    => it is feedback based. if it do positive work it get rewards. the more 
    we test it, it get more good

=>ML belongs to the level data set(input and output)
=> batch learning => training the machine only one time and deploy it
=> online learning=> training the machine secondly and deploy it
    batch is more faster than online learning
